Times  Tuesdays and Thursdays, 9:00AM - 11:50AM    Location  In Person, TABOR 143, Southeast Campus       Course Description   A course primarily designed for students preparing for trigonometry or calculus. This course focuses on functions and their properties, including polynomial, rational, exponential, logarithmic, piecewise-defined, and inverse functions. These topics will be explored symbolically, numerically, and graphically in real-life applications and interpreted in context. This course emphasizes skill building, problem solving, modeling, reasoning, communication, connections with other disciplines, and the appropriate use of present-day technology. This course is part of Oregon Common Course Numbering. MTH 111 and MTH 111Z are equivalent at PCC. The PCC Mathematics Department recommends that students take MTH courses in consecutive terms. Audit available. Read the Course Content and Outcomes Guide here .    Learning Outcomes  Upon successful completion of this course, students should be able to:  Explore the concept of a function numerically, symbolically, verbally, and graphically and identify properties of functions both with and without technology.  Analyze polynomial, rational, exponential, and logarithmic functions, as well as piecewise-defined functions, in both algebraic and graphical contexts, and solve equations involving these function types.  Demonstrate algebraic and graphical competence in the use and application of functions including notation, evaluation, domain\/range, algebraic operations and composition, inverses, transformations, symmetry, rate of change, extrema, intercepts, asymptotes, and other behavior.  Use variables and functions to represent unknown quantities, create models, find solutions, and communicate an interpretation of the results.  Determine the reasonableness and implications of mathematical methods, solutions, and approximations in context.      "

You may purchase a paper copy for a small price, if you want.    Supplies  In this class, you will need:   Pencils with erasers    Note paper of your choice     Engineering paper for completing your homework write-ups    Ruler, straightedge, or protractor for drawing neat graphs. The bookstore has a bunch of nice options.       Software\/Hardware\/Equipment  We will be using a number of free software options in this class. To access these outside of our classroom, you will need to have access to a personal computer with a recommended browser installed. We will be accessing the following:    D2L Brightspace , our primary learning platform with PCC,     Desmos , a free online graphing calculator,     MyOpenMath , where you will complete weekly homework assignments and quizzes, and     Amplify Classroom , where we will occasionally complete lab activities.     Please visit the technology support section of Student Support Resources for a complete list of apps and tools for PCC students.    Accessibility  This course uses digital courseware, software, or texts that may cause barriers for those using assistive, or accessibility-related technologies.

Students who have not done the following will be dropped according to PCC's No Show Policy :   Attend all of the first days of class up to the drop deadline.    Enroll in the MyOpenMath course and complete the first week's assignments.    Complete and submit the first week's lab assignments.   If you are unable to complete one of these requirements but want to remain enrolled in the class, you must speak to me to make an alternative arrangement to show engagement in the course.   "

  "body": " Grading   For more information, please go to the PCC Grading Guidelines .    Graded Assignments     Attendance  Each day of class you will receive a grade based on arriving on time, having all of your required course materials, engaging and participating during the lab time, and staying until the end of class.    Homework  Each week will have a homework assignment on MyOpenMath (often split into two question sets, e.g. Homework 1a and Homework 1b) and a quiz. You will complete the homework in two parts.   First, you will answer the questions in MyOpenMath. The questions are set up to give you as many chances as you need to get the right answer. Many questions have supportive videos or explanations to help you through the problem, or another one like it. You can keep trying until you get all of the answers right.   Once you have gotten all of the correct answers, you will complete a homework write-up on paper. See the homework and lab guidelines for instructions for completing the homework write-up.   Quizzes are available to help you prepare for the exam. You are encouraged to do quizzes without book, notes, or other outside help. You may take the quiz up to three times, keeping the highest score.    Lab Work  Each day after a lecture covering the material, you will complete an activity with your group. For full credit, you will write up a conclusion to the activity using the same guidelines as the homework and submit at the end of class. See the homework and lab guidelines for instructions for completing the homework write-up.    Exams  There will be two exams.  The midterm exam will be on February 5 during our normal class time. It will cover functions in general. The final exam will be on March 12 during our normal class time. It will cover exponential functions, logarithmic functions, polynomials, rational functions, and models.  Exams are closed book and no notes. Scientific calculators will be allowed for making small calculations.        Homework and Lab Guidelines  When submitting homework in this class, please follow these organizational guidelines. These help keep assignments neat and consistent, which makes it easier for me to grade and return them to you promptly. More details and an example homework submission are available on D2L.   Perform all initial work separately on scratch paper, then copy your final work and process neatly ontol paper for submission. Submissions including excessive scratch work, corrections, and unplanned organization will not be accepted.    Follow the format guide outlined on D2L. This includes   A header with your first and last name, the class number, and the assignment name    Clearly defined sections organizing your work    Questions organized vertically in a single column    Graphs drawn neatly with a straightedge, including scale    Each question stated completely before your work       All work should be done on engineering paper and submitted in person, due the next class meeting after the MyOpenMath due date. If you have to submit your work online, you must follow these instructions:  Scan or photograph each page of your work so it is clear and well-lit.  Correctly orient each page so that it is upright.  Organize your scans into a single PDF document for upload.  Title your file \"Firstname-Lastname-Assignment-Name-Number.pdf\", for example Miranda-Ramsey-Problem-Set-1.pdf .  Upload your work to D2L under the appropriate assignment. Emailed work will not be accepted unless previously arranged.         Late Work and Make-Up Policy  Students are expected to complete all assignments on pace with the course. However, I understand that external things get in the way. On MyOpenMath, students are given six \"latepasses\" which they may use to apply extensions to their work.   All homework assignments must be completed before the final exam, regardless of late passes.   For assignments without late passes, I will consider giving up to 1 week extension when requested before the original due date of the assignment.  If you must miss an exam, you must arrange a make up exam with me before the day of the exam.    Criteria  Please read over all assignments and discussion prompts in advance and reach out if you have any questions or if you want to confirm you understand them correctly. Clarifying questions will help you avoid deductions in your grades.
