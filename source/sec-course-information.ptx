		<title>Course Description</title>
        <introduction>
			<p>
                A course primarily designed for students preparing for trigonometry or calculus. 
                This course focuses on functions and their properties, including polynomial,
                rational, exponential, logarithmic, piecewise-defined, and inverse functions. These
                topics will be explored symbolically, numerically, and graphically in real-life 
                applications and interpreted in context. This course emphasizes skill building,
                problem solving, modeling, reasoning, communication, connections with other 
                disciplines, and the appropriate use of present-day technology. This course is part 
                of Oregon Common Course Numbering. MTH 111 and MTH 111Z are equivalent at PCC. 
                The PCC Mathematics Department recommends that students take MTH courses in 
                consecutive terms. Audit available.

			<title>Learning Outcomes</title>
			<p>
                Upon successful completion of this course, students should be able to:
				<ol>
					<li>
                        Explore the concept of a function numerically, symbolically, verbally, and 
                        graphically and identify properties of functions both with and without 
                        technology.
					</li>
					<li>
                        Analyze polynomial, rational, exponential, and logarithmic functions, as 
                        well as piecewise-defined functions, in both algebraic and graphical 
                        contexts, and solve equations involving these function types.
					</li>
					<li>
                        Demonstrate algebraic and graphical competence in the use and application 
                        of functions including notation, evaluation, domain/range, algebraic 
                        operations and composition, inverses, transformations, symmetry, rate of 
                        change, extrema, intercepts, asymptotes, and other behavior.
					</li>
					<li>
                        Use variables and functions to represent unknown quantities, create models,
                        find solutions, and communicate an interpretation of the results.
					</li>
					<li>
                        Determine the reasonableness and implications of mathematical methods, 
                        solutions, and approximations in context.
					</li>
				</ol>
