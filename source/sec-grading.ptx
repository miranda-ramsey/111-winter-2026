                    <p>
                        Each day of class you will receive a grade based on arriving on time, 
                        having all of your required course materials, engaging and participating 
                        during the lab time, and staying until the end of class.

                    <title>Homework</title>
                    <p>
                        Each week will have a homework assignment on MyOpenMath (often split into two
                        question sets, e.g. Homework 1a and Homework 1b) and a quiz. You will complete the
                        homework in two parts.
                    </p>
                    <ol><li>
                    <p>
                        First, you will answer the questions in MyOpenMath. The questions are set up
                        to give you as many chances as you need to get the right answer. Many questions 
                        have supportive videos or explanations to help you through the problem, or 
                        another one like it. You can keep trying until you get all of the answers right.
                    </p>
                    </li><li>
                    <p>
                        Once you have gotten all of the correct answers, you will complete a homework
                        write-up on paper. See the <xref ref="work-guidelines">homework and lab guidelines</xref>
                        for instructions for completing the homework write-up.

                    <p>
                        Quizzes are available to help you prepare for the exam. You are encouraged to do
                        quizzes without book, notes, or other outside help. You may take the quiz up
                        to three times, keeping the highest score.

                    <title>Lab Work</title>
                    <p>
                        Each day after a lecture covering the material, you will complete an activity
                        with your group. For full credit, you will write up a conclusion to the activity
                        using the same guidelines as the homework and submit at the end of class.
                        See the <xref ref="work-guidelines">homework and lab guidelines</xref>
                        for instructions for completing the homework write-up.

                        There will be two exams.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The midterm exam will be on February 5 during our normal class time. It will
                        cover functions in general.
                        The final exam will be on March 12 during our normal class time. It will cover
                        exponential functions, logarithmic functions, polynomials, rational functions, and models.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Exams are closed book and no notes. Scientific calculators will be allowed
                        for making small calculations.

                    <title>Final Project</title>
                    <p>
                        After the midterm exam, students will be invited to form groups to work on
                        a final project. Some class time will be available to work on the project 
                        together, and presentations will be given during our scheduled Final's week meeting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Projects will be student led inquiries into a particular function or function
                        family that exists within a chosen field. Depending on the function chosen,
                        the exploration will include example data; historical context; interpretations
                        of domains, extrema, and other features; and other topics of discussion that 
                        relate the concepts learned in class to a mathematical function in the real world.

                    <p>
                        Some example topics include Ohm's Law, carrying capacity, carbon dating, 
                        taxation, cryptography, or a preview into trigonometry.

        <title>Homework and Lab Guidelines</title>
		<p>
            When submitting homework in this class, please follow these organizational guidelines. 
            These help keep assignments neat and consistent, which makes it easier for me to grade
            and return them to you promptly. More details and an example homework submission are
            available on D2L.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Perform all initial work separately on scratch paper, then copy your final
                        work and process neatly ontol paper for submission. Submissions including 
                        excessive scratch work, corrections, and unplanned organization will not be
                        accepted.

                                Scan or photograph each page of your work so it is clear and well-lit.

        <title>Late Work and Make-Up Policy</title>
		<p>
            Students are expected to complete all assignments on pace with the course. However, I 
            understand that external things get in the way. On MyOpenMath, students are given six
            "latepasses" which they may use to apply extensions to their work.
		</p>
		<p>
            <em>All homework assignments must be completed before the final exam, regardless of late
                passes.</em>
		</p>
        <p>
            For assignments without late passes, I will consider giving up to 1 week extension 
            when requested <em>before</em> the original due date of the assignment.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you must miss an exam, you must arrange a make up exam with me before the day of the
            exam.
        </p>

        <title>Criteria</title>
        <p>
            Please read over all assignments and discussion prompts in advance and reach out if you
            have any questions or if you want to confirm you understand them correctly. Clarifying
            questions will help you avoid deductions in your grades.
